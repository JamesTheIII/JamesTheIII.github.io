Chrome Hearts Dagger Pendant
---
Modeled in Maya and Zbrush. Then I baked and textured in Substance Painter. Final Renders were in Blender with Cycles. The art I referenced is a Jewelry Piece from the luxury brand Chrome Hearts. I Tried to make this as close to realism as I could and I feel like I got it there. I really enjoyed modeling from reference and the mental puzzles of how to recreate it as close to reference as possible.
